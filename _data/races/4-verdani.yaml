description: |
  Plant-based humanoids with bark-like skin and photosynthetic capabilities, 
  the Verdani are living bridges between technology and nature. They can 
  supplement their nutrition through light absorption and have natural 
  regenerative abilities. Their deep understanding of biological systems makes
  them exceptional at life sciences and terraforming. While not the fastest
  of the creatures, they make up for it with incredible resilience
  and patience.
