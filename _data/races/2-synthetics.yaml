  Human consciousness housed in artificial bodies, combining biological thought 
  with mechanical precision. Created through advanced medical procedures that
  preserve the brain while replacing everything else, they excel in technical 
  fields and dangerous environments where their durable frames provide 
  advantages. Despite their artificial bodies, they maintain fully human 
  personalities and desires, though many believe the process strips them
  of the natural intuition humans have.
