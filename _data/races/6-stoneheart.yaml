description: |
  Massive, rocky humanoids with silicon-based physiology and incredible
  durability, the Stoneheart are living mountains. Their crystalline 
  formations can interface directly with technological systems, making 
  them natural engineers despite their imposing appearance. They speak 
  slowly and deliberately, thinking in geological timescales. Their 
  incredible strength and resilience make them nearly unstoppable 
  once they commit to action.
