description: |
  A mysterious alien species that exists partially outside normal reality, 
  Umbrans appear as shifting, shadowy humanoid figures. Their natural 
  ability to phase between dimensions makes them master infiltrators and 
  scouts. Their natural form of communication uses subtle mental emanations,
  but are able to project sound when they wish. Rarely seen unless they 
  choose to be, their otherworldly nature makes them excellent at 
  stealth and espionage operations.
