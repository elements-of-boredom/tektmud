name: Voidborn
description: |
  Descendants of humans who spent generations traveling between stars, the 
  Voidborn have adapted to life in deep space. Their pale, elongated 
  forms and enlarged eyes reflect their comfort in low-gravity, low-light 
  environments. They possess an intuitive understanding of stellar 
  navigation and cosmic phenomena. Having never known planetary life, 
  they feel most at home in the endless void between worlds.
