Massive, rocky humanoids with silicon-based physiology and incredible
durability, the Stoneheart are living mountains. Their crystalline 
formations can interface directly with technological systems, making 
them natural engineers despite their imposing appearance. They speak 
slowly and deliberately, thinking in geological timescales. Their 
incredible strength and resilience make them nearly unstoppable 
once they commit to action.
