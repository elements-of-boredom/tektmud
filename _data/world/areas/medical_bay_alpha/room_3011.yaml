description: |
  Towering data storage units line the walls of this repository, containing 
  medical records and research data from across the galaxy. Holographic 
  interfaces float at various workstations, allowing researchers to access 
  vast databases of medical knowledge. The gentle hum of cooling systems 
  keeps the servers at optimal temperature.
